# Hi, I'm Nifemi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a CS student at The University of Kansas pursuing an undergraduate certificate in cybersecurity. I'm interested in full-stack development and building tools with users in mind. I enjoy the challenge of taking an idea from concept to deployment and figuring out how all the pieces fit together.

Most of my experience is in Python, C#, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and SQL. I've worked with tools like Git, Postman, AWS, and Azure DevOps, and I enjoy working with REST APIs, automation scripts, and CI/CD pipelines.

Overall, I'm someone who loves solving problems, building products, and continuously learning new technologies.
