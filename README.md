Hello, my name is Nifemi Lawal. I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Kansas. I am a creative individual who enjoys solving problems and bringing ideas to life through technology. I have experience with Python, C, C++, C#, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, as well as working with frameworks like Flask and Express.js. My experience also includes working with REST APIs, WebSocket, SQLite, and tools like Postman for testing and development.

Beyond software, I tackle technical challenges in 3D printing and mechanical design, utilizing tools like Fusion360 and SolidWorks.
