Hello, my name is Nifemi Lawal. I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Kansas. I'm a creative individual who enjoys solving problems and bringing ideas to life through technology. I have experience with Python, C, C++, C#, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks such as Flask and Express.js. I'm currently working with REST APIs, WebSocket, SQLite, and tools like Postman for testing and development.

Beyond software, I tackle technical challenges in 3D printing and mechanical design, using tools like Fusion360 and SolidWorks.
